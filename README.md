First, Importing necessary libraries and Loading data from the provided URL
This section imports the required libraries: pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib for plotting, and scikit-learn for machine learning. The pd.read_csv(url) command loads the dataset from the given URL, and print(s_data.head(5)) displays the first 5 rows of the dataset for a quick overview.
here is the output shows first 5 rows of the data frame..

ok next: Plotting the relationship between Hours a nd Scores
Here, a scatter plot is created to visualize the relationship between the 'Hours Studied' and 'Percentage Score.' s_data.plot() is used to create the plot, and the subsequent lines set the title and labels for better clarity. Here the is the scatter showing the relationship between 'Hours Studied' and 'Percentage Score.'

Now to Preparing the data for training
This part prepares the data for training the model. It extracts the 'Hours Studied' as feature (X) and 'Percentage Score' as the target variable (y). train_test_split is used to split the data into training and testing sets, with 80% for training and 20% for testing. Here we run the code.. and now we have our data set splitted into training and testing sets with 20 percent of the set for testing.

Now we move to Creating and training the Linear Regression model
In this section, a linear regression model is created using LinearRegression() class , and then it is trained with the training data using fit(). Running the code we see The message "Training complete." is printed to indicate that the model has been trained successfully.

Now to Plotting the regression line
This code plots the regression line on top of the scatter plot. The scatter plot represents the actual data points, and the line represents the model's prediction.
with help of 
coef_ attribute represents the slope of the line
And intercept_ which represents the y-intercept of the linear regression model.
running the code we see our scatter points fitted by the regression line.

Good

Now with Predicting the scores on the test set
Here, the model is used to predict scores on the test set (X_test). The results are then organized in a DataFrame for easy comparison between actual scores in the test part of the set and the predicted scores.

We can also Predict the score for a student who studied x hours, but first we ensure the score doesn't exceed 100. for example a student who studied 11 hours will get a score of 100 (full mark).

Evaluating the model performance
Finally, the code evaluates the model's performance. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared are calculated and printed. These metrics provide insights into how well the model is making predictions on the test set.

What I've Learned in This Task:
- How to import and explore a dataset using pandas.
- Creating informative visualizations using matplotlib.
- Preparing data for machine learning, splitting it into training and testing sets.
- Building and training a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn.
- Evaluating the model's performance with metrics like Mean Absolute Error and R-squared.
- Making predictions on new data points.
- MAE represents the average absolute difference between the actual and predicted values.
- R-squared measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).
- a high R-squared value and a relatively low MAE are positive indicators.
